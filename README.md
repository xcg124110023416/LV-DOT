## I. Installation Guide
The system requirements for this repository are as follows. Please ensure your system meets these requirements:
- Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 LTS
- ROS Melodic/Noetic

This package has been tested on the following onboard computer:
- [NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-series/)
- [NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/) 
- [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html)
 

Please follow the instructions below to install this package.
```
# This package needs ROS vision_msgs package
sudo apt install ros-noetic-vision-msgs

# Install YOLOv11 required package
pip install ultralytics

cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/LV-DOT.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```


## II. Run Demo
### a. Run on dataset
Please download the rosbag file from this [link](https://cmu.box.com/s/cucvje5b9xfpdpe57ilh0jx702b3ks2p):
```
rosbag play -l corridor_demo.bag
roslaunch onboard_detector run_detector.launch
```
The perception results can be visualized in Rviz as follows:

### b. Run on your device
Please adjust the configuration file under ```cfg/detector_param.yaml``` of your LiDAR and camera device. Also, change the color image topic name in ```scripts/yolo_detector/yolov11_detector.py```

From the parameter file, you can find that the algorithm expects the following data from the robot:
- LiDAR Point Cloud: ```/pointcloud```

- Depth image: ```/camera/depth/image_rect_raw```

- Color image: ```/camera/color/image_rect_raw```

- Robot pose: ```/mavros/local_position/pose```

- Robot odometry (alternative to robot pose): ```/mavros/local_position/odom```

Additionally, update the camera intrinsic parameters and the camera-LiDAR extrinsic parameters in the config file.

Run the following command to launch dynamic obstacle detection and tracking.
```
# Launch your sensor device first. Make sure it has the above data.
roslaunch onboard_detector run_detector.launch
```

The LV-DOT can be directly utilized to assist mobile robot navigation and collision avoidance in dynamic environments, as demonstrated below:

## III. LV-DOT Framework and Results
The LV-DOT framework is shown below. Using onboard LiDAR, camera, and odometry inputs, the LiDAR and depth detection modules detect 3D obstacles, while the color detection module identifies 2D dynamic obstacles. The LiDAR-visual fusion module refines these detections, and the tracking module classifies obstacles as static or dynamic.
